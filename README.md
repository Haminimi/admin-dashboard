# Admin Dashboard
## Description
This Admin Dashboard project is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)'s [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard). The Odin Project provides a high quality web development education maintained by an open source community.
## Live Demo
This is the project's [design file](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png) and here is the [Admin Dashboard](https://haminimi.github.io/admin-dashboard/) built by [me](https://github.com/Haminimi).
## Main Features
- **Modern and Aesthetic Design:** The dashboard boasts a sleek and minimalist user interface, characterized by clean lines and a clutter-free design. Interactive elements such as subtle hover effects, transitions, and animations provide an engaging and responsive interface.
- **Responsive Design:** The project is primarily meant for desktop users, and as such, it doesn't offer support for mobile devices and other smaller screens. However, the dashboard does support window resizing down to a certain point and provide a consistent user experience across various desktop screens.

**To Do:**
- **Dark Mode**
- **Fully Responsive Design**
## Tech
**The project is built with:**
- HTML
- Vanilla CSS
## Reflection
The project significantly improved my understanding of CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox. Currently, I am learning only Vanilla CSS and building projects with it. But I am also looking forward to learning CSS Frameworks and further enhancing my knowledge in areas like animations and responsive design.
